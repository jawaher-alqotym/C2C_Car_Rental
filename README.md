## Idea:
A platform to facilitate renting cars for both car owners and car drivers. The system will help users find a car to rent directly from the car owner without a “middle-man” and allow anyone with a car to further benefit from it and generate an additional income by putting it up for rent.

## Inspiration:
Facilitate the renting process while reducing car renting costs. Also, the C2C car rental business model is not represented enough(if at all) in KSA.

## Project Impact and challenges:
The project helps reduce car renting costs and gas costs for users(the person who rents the car will pay for the gas). Although the idea is promising it has some weaknesses like authenticating the car owner and car rentee. Not many people would be happy to see strangers drive their car without being sure of their identity and people are reluctant to pay without a guarantee of the existence of that car. However, we can get around these weaknesses by requiring both parties to register an account to establish some credentials and provide a personal page for both with reviews.
